The AI bot in this chess game is a sophisticated chess engine that uses several advanced techniques to provide challenging gameplay across five difficulty levels:

Core AI Architecture

Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning: The bot uses the classic minimax algorithm to evaluate potential moves by looking ahead several moves into the future. Alpha-beta pruning optimizes this by eliminating branches that won't affect the final decision, making the AI much faster.

Position Evaluation: The bot evaluates chess positions using multiple factors:

Material Value: Standard piece values (pawn=100, knight=320, bishop=330, rook=500, queen=900, king=20000)

Positional Value: Uses piece-square tables to prefer better piece placement

Center Control: Rewards controlling central squares (d4, d5, e4, e5)

King Safety: Discourages early king moves in the opening

Development: Penalizes moving the same piece multiple times early in the game

Difficulty Levels

Very Easy: Plays completely random legal moves - perfect for absolute beginners learning the rules.

Easy: Mostly random but has a 60% chance to prefer captures when available, adding slight tactical awareness.

Medium: Uses basic position evaluation to find the best moves, with some randomness added to keep games interesting. Considers material gain, piece positioning, and basic tactics.

Hard: Implements 3-ply minimax search (looks 3 moves ahead) with full position evaluation. This creates a strong tactical player that can spot combinations and avoid blunders.

Very Hard: Uses 4-ply minimax search with move ordering optimization. Sorts moves by initial evaluation to improve alpha-beta pruning efficiency, creating an expert-level opponent that plays near-optimal chess.

Smart Features

The bot includes several intelligent behaviors:

Opening Principles: Avoids moving the king early and encourages piece development

Tactical Awareness: Spots captures, threats, and defensive moves

Endgame Understanding: Maintains strong play throughout all game phases

Adaptive Timing: Takes a 1-second pause before moving to create a natural playing experience

This creates a chess opponent that scales from teaching tool to serious challenge, making it suitable for players of all skill levels.
